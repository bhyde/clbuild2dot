The file do-dot.lisp contains a single routine cl-user:generate-drawing of no
arguments.  Invoke it when your current directory set to the clbuild directory; and it will spit out a graphviz/dot[1] drawing of your installed modules and thier dependencies as recorded in the dependencies file.

The file presumes the cl-ppcre[3] is present.

Example output from an slightly earlier version can be seen here[2].
